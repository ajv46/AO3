  **Glossary**
**Branch**: A branch in a computer program is an instruction that tells a computer to begin executing different instructions rather than simply executing the instructions in order.
**Clone** : The creation of the duplicate website of that concept and script. 
**Commit**: saving changes to the main object.
**Fetch** :Fetch provides a generic definition of Request and Response objects
**GIT**: software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
**Github**: a "social coding" site. It allows you to upload code repositories for storage in the Git version control system. You can then collaborate on code projects, and the system is open-source by default, meaning that anyone in the world can find your GitHub code, use it, learn from it, and improve on it.
**Merge**: To combine two separate sets of data into one set
**Merge Conflict**: Merge conflicts occur when two branches have different changes that cannot be merged automatically.  The merge commit can be reviewed and tested before the changes are merged. This prevents unintended changes entering the target branch without review or breaking the build.
**Push**: actionable messages sent to a visitor's device from a website via a browser
**Pull**:  to request data from another program or computer.
**Remote** A remote site is a website that is physically located a distance away from the user's site.
**Repository**: a central file storage location that stores multiple files.
